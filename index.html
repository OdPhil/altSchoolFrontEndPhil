        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p class="text">
            I am Philip C. Odinakachi. Born on the 27th of June, 1998, I'm a graduate of Accounting from the University of Benin. My transition into the tech space started with my love for graphic design while in university around 2017. I'd create flyers and posters on my phone. From then, I took a course in Graphic Design on Domestika and began doing professional graphic design. I then took interest in UI/UX and ultimately Front-End Engineering. After completing a FrontEnd Engineering Certificate Programme by Meta on Coursera, I decided to venture into a totally new niche which is Cloud Engineering. This brought me to the AltSchool Cloud Engineering programme.</p>

            <h2>Why I Joined AltSchool:</h2>
        <p class="text">
            I was introduced to AltSchool by a friend of mine who was then in the Cloud Engineering Programme (now graduated). He told me the learning structure and curriculum was very extensive and by far the best one could get in Nigeria presently. I was intrigued and captivated by the idea and decided to apply for the programme as well.
